title: Asch FAQ
---

# 1 The brief introduction of Asch

The original design purpose of Asch is to reduce the skill threshold for the developers.For example,
it makes DAPP development and traditional web applications become quite similar by adopting JavaScript
as an application development language and supporting RDB (Relational Database) to store the transaction data,
which must be extremely attractive to developers and SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises).We believe the
ecosystem of the whole platform will not be developed rapidly unless developers’ productivity could be promoted.
Asch is also an open platform which is not limited to a particular area, such as finance, document storage,
copyright proof etc, but providing a series of underlying and abstract APIs which can be combined freely to realize
various kinds of application. In addition, Asch system inherits and  enhances DPOS(Delegated Proof of Stake) algorithm
in its consensus mechanism to significantly reduce the probability of block fork and the risk of duplicate payment.
Most importantly, Asch’s sidechain-is-application mode can not only alleviate the blockchain inflation issue, but also
make DApp more flexible and characteristic. Asch is a prospective, low-cost, one-stop solution that is surely able to
be the incubator of next generation decentralized application. The token of Asch is XAS, and the initial amount of
XAS is 100 million. See Asch official website for details.

# 3 What is the Asch Wallet?

Please be sure to back up the master password of wallet when you use your Asch wallet. If forget your master password,
you will never open your wallet. When you input master password, please note the space to avoid getting different
wallet address.

Old wallet address of Asch system is digital, later upgraded to letters.  Both can be compatible, but some exchanges
can not be compatible. So old users should  pay  attention to exchange currency to use new wallet letters address as
far as possible.

How do we use wallet?

Freshman must see how to manipulate Asch account proficiently.
[Notes for wallet users](http://bbs.asch.so/topic/23/%E9%92%B1%E5%8C%85%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E9%A1%BB%E7%9F%A5)

Local Wallet（全节点钱包）

If you want to install Local Wallet by yourself, please refer to this document [Asch Node Installation Guide](https://github.com/AschPlatform/asch-docs/blob/master/asch_install.md).

Mobile Wallet

Mobile wallet only needs to enter a master password when login to mobile wallet. Then set the gesture password. After that, using the gesture password can access the wallet.

# 4 What language is used to develop Asch?

Asch platform is developed by Node.js language. There are some underlying developed modules with C or C++ language.
If there are bottlenecks in performance, you can use C or C ++ to modularize it at all.

If you want to develop Asch platform itself, Node.js is the necessary skill, follow-up to add  SDK of mainstream
development language like java, python, php, Go etc.

# 5 What frameworks does Asch use?

Asch itself is a framework that is easy for users to develop Dapp of blockchain-level. Because it is developed by Node.
Js, some existing modules are using, such as express.

# 6 What features does Asch have?

1. Support side-chain (cross-chain). Store Dapp data in the side-chain, and then the main chain data will not swell too fast.
2. Advantages of Node.JS language.
3. Storage block data of relational database to reduce the difficulty of Dapp development
4. The speed of block production is fast. Produce a block in every 10 seconds and confirm it fast.
5. There will be no bifurcation.
6. Safe sandbox isolation mechanism

# 7 Why will Asch not bifurcate?

Asch system uses consensus which is based on DPOS,the delegate election system,but on the bottom half of the algorithm
we use a optimized and variant PBFT algorithm.This algorithm can achieve the consistency of the loyal nodes by the time
complexity of O(n ^ 2) and message complexity of O(1) at t<n/3 to prevent bifurcation,in the equation t presents the
number of the Byzantine Failures nodes(any possible problems like network latency,system crash,vicious attack and so on),
n presents the number of all nodes.

# 8 Can Asch be mined?

Asch uses a non-Pow algorithm, so it can not be mined. But it can be used to obtain the benefit forging by delegators.

Asch use AC1.0 consensus algorithm(a optimized dpos with pbft algorithm),ensure the output of blocks through the delegate system.

Everyone can register to be a delegate,everyone can vote for any delegate,but only the top 101 delegates who get the
most votes can forge blocks(accounting).Now delegate can get 3.5 XAS as reward for forging one block,and each block
takes 10 seconds to be forged.

# 9 How many are the initial circulations of Asch?

Asch's initial circulation is 100 million. For details, see the Asch ICO scheme.

# 10 How much is Asch trustees’s returns?

Gross profit per day: 24*60*60/10*3.5=30240 XAS

Each trustee’s gross profit per day: 30240/101=299.4 XAS

The block rewards will decrease over time.Please click to see the details.

# 11 How do we issue our own assets by Asch?

# 12 Which platforms does Asch support?

Currently, only the Linux platform is fully supported, while Windows can synchronize blocks but cannot produce blocks.
And other platforms will support later.

# 13 Comparision among Asch, ETH and LISK

Comparision between Asch and ETH

|name|ASCH|ETH|
|-----|------|-------|
|Consensus mechanism|DPOS+PBFT Compared to pow,DPOS and PBFT focuses more on decentration. Pow has the problem of calculating force or centralization of miners. Compared with pos,pow’s right to keep accounts is transferred to the trustees, but the shareholders still have the decision-making right, more security and decentralization.|Pow+pos|
|Smart contract implementation|side-chain. The data is in dapp.|Transaction scripts.  The data is all in the main chain, easily expanding.|
|Contract language|Native javascript|Solidity is operated on evm.ETH lacks of documents,with little appropriate users and high threshold.|
|expansibility|The application of side chain and side chain can be downloaded as users needs without causing the main chain expansion.|The surge of Dapp will pose risks to the whole blockchain.|
|security|The side chain operates independently ,without affecting the main chain.|The Dapp vulnerability will affect the whole blockchain, such as the dao event.|
|confirmation time of block|10s|15s|
|TPS|3000|20|

Comparision between Asch and LISK

|name|ASCH|LISK|
|-----|------|-------|
|Consensus mechanism|DPOS+PBFT There is not fork and double-payment risk attacked by hackers.|DPOS,furcation and fixture block.|
|sandbox|Real sandbox can limit side chain’s permissions.|ETH cannot restrict the side chain’s permission.|
|Non-critical refinement and optimization |1.Create and sign the transaction at the front and transfer the encrypted data to the back.2.As long as the problem of front-end performance is solved,it will not cause dpos to system itself.3.As data persistence, the savepoint of databaseand the rollback is widely adopted. Although in poor network conditions, it won’t fix blocks and furcate.|The user's password is transmitted directly to the back-end, which is easy to record and access.|

# 17 What is the Asch inflation rate?
The block bonus  will decline by the time,the specific time is based on the height of a block in the future. The block bonus  system starts form 464500, with an initial reward of 3.5 coins, and is reduced every 3 million blocks  in 1 years. After the 15464500 block, bonuses are no longer diminishing, with a slight inflation rate of less than 1.5% a year (relative to the initial amount of 100 million).
The  inflation rate is as follow： (calculated from the 464500 block, because there are block rewards at this time, probably around October 7, 2016)

|Years|inflation rate relieve to last year|Current block bonus sum(ten thousandXAS)|
|-----|------|-------|
|First year|10.5%|1050|
|Secend year|7.5%|900|
|Third year|5.9%|750|
|Fouth year|4.5%|600|
|Fifth year|2.2%|300|
|Sixth year|1.1%|150|


Here are the blocks of rewards at all stages:

# 20 Side-chain (cross-chain) Introduction

The side chain refers not to Asch as the side chain of the other block chain, but to the Asch that has its own side chain,Dapp.

Currently only use nodejs development, if you want to use Java, python, PHP and other language development, as long as the corresponding SDK can be done, we can try to write, mainly to Asch-js this library written in other languages.

For convenient to Dapp development, Qingfeng was doing optimization, Asch2.0 will be released.
The existing documents are as follows:
Asch Dapp development introduced: side chain related technical notes.
Dapp development 1: Asch Dapp Hello World: this document will teach you how to create and publish a basic side chain applications, and introduce the source code structure of the side chain framework.
Dapp development 2: Asch, Dapp, Asset
Dapp development 3 : Asch Dapp Mini DAO, and this document teaches you how to create new transaction types or smart contracts, and provides a mini Dao project that includes project management and voting functions as a demonstration
Dapp development 4: Asch Dapp Dice Game development tutorial, this
document teach you how to create more complex types of transactions or intelligent contract, how to establish the association between the contract, how to enforce contracts to rely on historical transaction data, and the realization of a dice game as a demo.
Dapp development 5: release Dapp to the online, this document teaches you how to register on the online system (testnet, mainnet), and how to install and uninstall.
